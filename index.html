<!-- To-do list

- Insert new mechanics - gain points instead of die for chicken
- Insert restart
- Make things go faster over time
- Add in background music
- Add in sound effects
- Change game size to 100% of screen, variable

Optional: Gif sprites, see below. 

Allow the enemies and player to have animated sprites instead of the current static ones. You could do this by defining a sprite as an array of
images and setting a speed at which these images should switch. This could be implemented in the render method.
